Revision history for Bencher-Backend

0.40    2016-03-16 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add action: list-perls; by default only use perls that have
          Bencher::Backend installed.

        - [Bugfix] Avoid benchmarking duplicate items, e.g. 'perl -e1
          (baseline)' when in module_startup mode + multimodver mode.

        - [Bugfix] fix calculating mod_overhead_time when in multiperl mode.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Support benchmarking against multiple perls (introduce options
          `--multiperl`, `--include-perl`, `--exclude-perl`). Limitation:
          Currently this is implemented by dumping (using Data::Dmp, which means
          using B::Deparse) the items' codes into a temporary scenario file,
          then executing the scenario file using each perl executable. This
          means codes that contains closures (references to outside variable)
          won't work correctly.

        - Support benchmarking multiple versions of a module (`--multimodver`).
          To do this, first add more module search paths using `--include-path`
          (`-I`).

        - In participant, introduce 'perl_cmdline' and 'perl_cmdline_template'
          in addition to 'cmdline' and 'cmdline_template'. They are the same as
          'cmdline*' except there is implicit first argument which is the perl
          executable. They are for executing commands using perl, without having
          to hardcode/include the perl executable location.


0.38    2016-03-15 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release, split from Bencher distribution.
