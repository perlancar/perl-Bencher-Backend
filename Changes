Revision history for Bencher-Backend

1.007   2016-04-19 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] save_result was turned *on* all the time, it should be
	  only when --save-result or (--result-dir or BENCHER_RESULT_DIR
	  was set).


1.006   2016-04-13 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add --{in,ex}clude-{participant,dataset,item}-{name,seq} to
          unambiguously include/exclude by name or sequence.

        - [ux] Warn when there is a participant/dataset/item which has name that
          is also a sequence number, which can be confusing when
          including/excluding.

        - [Bugfix] Defeat the annoying compile errors when using Capture::Tiny
          due to mismatching prototypes.


1.005   2016-04-08 (PERLANCAR)

	[ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add --include-process-size to show process memory stats.

	- Add output capturing (--show-items-outputs, --capture-stdout,
	  --capture-stderr).

	[BUG FIXES]

        - Regression: --show-items-results and --show-items-results-sizes
          returned JSON by default when it should return a formatted text.

	- When trying to come up with a name for a command participant, also
	  take a look at cmdline_template/perl_cmdline/perl_cmdline_template in
	  addition to just cmdline.


1.004   2016-04-08 (PERLANCAR)

	- Eval code template in 'main' package.

        - Allow <VARNAME:raw> in template to avoid escaping.


1.003   2016-04-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] completer for participant/dataset name didn't include
	  generated names.

	- [Bugfix] save_result was not turned on automatically when user
	  sets result_dir.


1.002   2016-04-01 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bug] Logic bug: --return-meta accidentally defaulted to off when
	  --save-result is not enabled.


1.001   2016-04-01 (PERLANCAR)

	- Turn off include_result_size when in module startup mode.

	- Add feature to save result to a JSON file (--save-result,
	  --result-dir, --result-filename).

	- Grok scenario property 'extra_modules' to allow extra modules to
	  be loaded and their versions recorded in benchmark result
	  metadata.


1.000   2016-03-31 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - Bump version number to 1.000.


0.46    2016-03-31 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

        - [doc] Add description, fixes.


0.45    2016-03-30 (PERLANCAR)

	- [ux] Check that what's specified in
	  --{in,ex}clude-{dataset,participant,item} are actually known, to
	  avoid silent surprise.

	- [Bugfix] Fix typo that caused sometimes specifying
	  --include-participant by name doesn't work.

	- [Bugfix] RoundNumbers formatter: no need to round result_size
	  except when it's not a round number.


0.44    2016-03-26 (PERLANCAR)

	- Show result size (as measured by Devel::Size), add
	  --include-result-size (& include_result_size scenario property),
	  add action show-items-results-sizes.

	- [Bugfix] Fix completion of -m when there is -I specified.


0.43    2016-03-24 (PERLANCAR)

	- [ux] Directory specified in -I (--include-path) is now also used
	  for searching and loading scenario module, this is so we can say
	  something like 'bencher -Ilib -m Foo' instead of 'PERL5OPT=-Ilib
	  bencher -m Foo'.

	- [ux] When a dataset has no name, try to assign a name from
	  argument value.


0.42    2016-03-22 (PERLANCAR)

	- Allow specifying 'modules' in participant to benchmark startup
	  overhead of several modules at once.


0.41    2016-03-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] Include modver & perl in result items even when in not
	  multiperl/multimodver mode (ModuleStartup formatter module uses
	  the perl key).

	- Add workaround for RT#113117 (List::MoreUtils sometimes return
	  undef max).


0.40    2016-03-16 (PERLANCAR)

        - Add action: list-perls; by default only use perls that have
          Bencher::Backend installed.

        - [Bugfix] Avoid benchmarking duplicate items, e.g. 'perl -e1
          (baseline)' when in module_startup mode + multimodver mode.

        - [Bugfix] fix calculating mod_overhead_time when in multiperl mode.


0.39    2016-03-15 (PERLANCAR)

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Support benchmarking against multiple perls (introduce options
          `--multiperl`, `--include-perl`, `--exclude-perl`). Limitation:
          Currently this is implemented by dumping (using Data::Dmp, which means
          using B::Deparse) the items' codes into a temporary scenario file,
          then executing the scenario file using each perl executable. This
          means codes that contains closures (references to outside variable)
          won't work correctly.

        - Support benchmarking multiple versions of a module (`--multimodver`).
          To do this, first add more module search paths using `--include-path`
          (`-I`).

        - In participant, introduce 'perl_cmdline' and 'perl_cmdline_template'
          in addition to 'cmdline' and 'cmdline_template'. They are the same as
          'cmdline*' except there is implicit first argument which is the perl
          executable. They are for executing commands using perl, without having
          to hardcode/include the perl executable location.


0.38    2016-03-15 (PERLANCAR)

        - First release, split from Bencher distribution to reduce dependencies
	  when installing Bencher to a perl installation (this is part of
	  developing support for benchmarking against multiple perls/module
	  versions).
