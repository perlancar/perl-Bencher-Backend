        - Add options: --exclude-xs-modules (--noxs) --exclude-pp-modules
          (--nopp).


1.026   2016-10-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add hooks before_parse_{datasets,participants} and deprecated
	  before_list_{datasets,participants}. To generate
	  datasets/participants dynamically, use the before_parse_* hooks
	  because the datasets/participants can later still be filtered.

	- Add hooks 'before_test_item' & 'after_test_item'.


1.025   2016-10-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] Several bug fixes.

        - Add property/option 'test' to skip testing participant code prior to
          benchmarking. Useful if code runs for at least a few seconds and we
          don't want to wait for too long.


1.024   2016-10-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] Remove action 'bench-with-benchmark-pm' (see
          below to run benchmark with Benchmark.pm).

        - Add property/option 'runner' which can be the default
          'Benchmark::Dumb', or 'Benchmark', or the new
          'Benchmark::Dumb::SimpleTime' which can be used if you want to
          benchmark code that runs for at least a few seconds with very few
          iterations (like 1 or 2) without "Number of runs too small" warning
          from Benchmark::Dumb.


1.023   2016-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Aside from observing per-dataset 'result' property, also observe
	  scenario's 'result' property for when we don't have any datasets.


1.022   2016-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [workaround] Some completions were broken because we use
	  'str_comma_sep' coercion rules for --include-path, this is
	  because include_path is now a string instead or array[str] before
	  validation+coercion, and completion currently does not use
	  Data::Sah, so now we disable this coercion rule for now.


1.021   2016-08-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Introduce --with-args-sizes.


1.020   2016-08-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Incompatible change] Rename options for consistency
	  --include-process-size to --with-process-size,
	  --include-result-size to --with-result-size (--include-* are for
	  filter options).

	- [ux] Add completion for comma-separated filter options, e.g.
	  --include-participants, --exclude-dataset-seqs, etc.


1.019   2016-08-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Allow specifying options like --include-datasets with
	  comma-separated value, so --include-datasets 1,2,3 instead of
	  --include-dataset 1 --include-dataset 2 --include-dataset 3 or
	  --include-datasets-json '[1,2,3]'.

	- [Bugfix][Regression] Accidentally removed a code to permute
	  dataset, breaking v1.018.


1.018   2016-08-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - UPDATE: this release is broken, don't use.

        [NEW FEATURES]

        - Allow items to be benchmarked using Benchmark.pm instead of
          Benchmark::Dumb. To do this, specify bencher option
          --bench-with-benchmark-pm. Currently if you do this, the raw result
          from Benchmark.pm will be used and no result table will be
          returned/saved. Also don't forget to set --benchmark-pm-count when
          appropriate (the default is -0.5).

        - Introduce scenario property 'env_hashes' (can also be set from the CLI
          using --env-hash). This allows permuting multiple environment variable
          sets.


1.017   2016-07-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add chart_result().


1.016   2016-07-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Include permutation in result metadata (func.permute).


1.015   2016-07-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Handle negative time in results.

	- [Bugfix] Still allow stringy matching of --include with name even
	  though value is a number.


1.014   2016-06-30  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add function: split_result().


1.013   2016-06-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Bugfix] Determine number of significant digits from 'time', not from
          'rate' because 'rate' is removed in module startup result.


1.012   2016-06-28  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- format_result(): Add a convenient way to skip using the
	  RenderAsTextTable formatter by passing option render_as_text_table=>0.

	- Avoid some perl undef warnings, e.g. for older bencher results where
	  'perl' field is not defined.


1.011   2016-06-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- More tweaks/fixes for alignments.


1.010   2016-06-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] DeleteConstantFields formatter didn't use
	  delete_fields() yet.


1.009   2016-06-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Add column alignment to result.

	- [ux] Use decimal notation by default, except for 'errors' field
	  or when option --scientific-notation is given.


1.008   2016-05-20  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Follow Sah::Schemas specification, rename
	  Sah::Schema::Bencher::Scenario to Sah::Schema::bencher::scenario.

	- Avoid perl undef warning.


1.007   2016-04-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] save_result was turned *on* all the time, it should be
	  only when --save-result or (--result-dir or BENCHER_RESULT_DIR
	  was set).


1.006   2016-04-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add --{in,ex}clude-{participant,dataset,item}-{name,seq} to
          unambiguously include/exclude by name or sequence.

        - [ux] Warn when there is a participant/dataset/item which has name that
          is also a sequence number, which can be confusing when
          including/excluding.

        - [Bugfix] Defeat the annoying compile errors when using Capture::Tiny
          due to mismatching prototypes.


1.005   2016-04-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	[ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Add --include-process-size to show process memory stats. UPDATE: this
          option has been renamed to --with-process-size in 1.020.

	- Add output capturing (--show-items-outputs, --capture-stdout,
	  --capture-stderr).

	[BUG FIXES]

        - Regression: --show-items-results and --show-items-results-sizes
          returned JSON by default when it should return a formatted text.

	- When trying to come up with a name for a command participant, also
	  take a look at cmdline_template/perl_cmdline/perl_cmdline_template in
	  addition to just cmdline.


1.004   2016-04-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Eval code template in 'main' package.

        - Allow <VARNAME:raw> in template to avoid escaping.


1.003   2016-04-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] completer for participant/dataset name didn't include
	  generated names.

	- [Bugfix] save_result was not turned on automatically when user
	  sets result_dir.


1.002   2016-04-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bug] Logic bug: --return-meta accidentally defaulted to off when
	  --save-result is not enabled.


1.001   2016-04-01  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Turn off include_result_size when in module startup mode.

	- Add feature to save result to a JSON file (--save-result,
	  --result-dir, --result-filename).

	- Grok scenario property 'extra_modules' to allow extra modules to
	  be loaded and their versions recorded in benchmark result
	  metadata.


1.000   2016-03-31  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - Bump version number to 1.000.


0.46    2016-03-31  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - [doc] Add description, fixes.


0.45    2016-03-30  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Check that what's specified in
	  --{in,ex}clude-{dataset,participant,item} are actually known, to
	  avoid silent surprise.

	- [Bugfix] Fix typo that caused sometimes specifying
	  --include-participant by name doesn't work.

	- [Bugfix] RoundNumbers formatter: no need to round result_size
	  except when it's not a round number.


0.44    2016-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Show result size (as measured by Devel::Size), add
          --include-result-size (& include_result_size scenario property), add
          action show-items-results-sizes. UPDATE: the option has been renamed
	  to --with-result-size in 1.020.

	- [Bugfix] Fix completion of -m when there is -I specified.


0.43    2016-03-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [ux] Directory specified in -I (--include-path) is now also used
	  for searching and loading scenario module, this is so we can say
	  something like 'bencher -Ilib -m Foo' instead of 'PERL5OPT=-Ilib
	  bencher -m Foo'.

	- [ux] When a dataset has no name, try to assign a name from
	  argument value.


0.42    2016-03-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Allow specifying 'modules' in participant to benchmark startup
	  overhead of several modules at once.


0.41    2016-03-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] Include modver & perl in result items even when in not
	  multiperl/multimodver mode (ModuleStartup formatter module uses
	  the perl key).

	- Add workaround for RT#113117 (List::MoreUtils sometimes return
	  undef max).


0.40    2016-03-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add action: list-perls; by default only use perls that have
          Bencher::Backend installed.

        - [Bugfix] Avoid benchmarking duplicate items, e.g. 'perl -e1
          (baseline)' when in module_startup mode + multimodver mode.

        - [Bugfix] fix calculating mod_overhead_time when in multiperl mode.


0.39    2016-03-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Support benchmarking against multiple perls (introduce options
          `--multiperl`, `--include-perl`, `--exclude-perl`). Limitation:
          Currently this is implemented by dumping (using Data::Dmp, which means
          using B::Deparse) the items' codes into a temporary scenario file,
          then executing the scenario file using each perl executable. This
          means codes that contains closures  Released-By: references to outside variable
          won't work correctly.

        - Support benchmarking multiple versions of a module (`--multimodver`).
          To do this, first add more module search paths using `--include-path`
          (`-I`).

        - In participant, introduce 'perl_cmdline' and 'perl_cmdline_template'
          in addition to 'cmdline' and 'cmdline_template'. They are the same as
          'cmdline*' except there is implicit first argument which is the perl
          executable. They are for executing commands using perl, without having
          to hardcode/include the perl executable location.


0.38    2016-03-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - First release, split from Bencher distribution to reduce dependencies
	  when installing Bencher to a perl installation (this is part of
	  developing support for benchmarking against multiple perls/module
	  versions).
